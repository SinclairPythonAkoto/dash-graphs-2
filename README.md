Dash-Graphs-2

This is a simple Flask app that allows the user to insert data into a PostgreSQL database. The data is then reloaded into a Dash bar chart for the user to view.

This second graph converts strings into integers to display the data.

This Dash app is inside the Flask app with a prefixed pathname so I can only create one graph for the user to view.
